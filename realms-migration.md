### Key Differences in Milestones

1. **Initial Setup**
   - Full Custom: Requires extensive planning and architecture design
   - Realms: Mostly configuration of existing components

2. **Core Development**
   - Full Custom: Must build all components from scratch
   - Realms: Focus only on chancellor-specific features

3. **Testing Requirements**
   - Full Custom: Comprehensive testing of all components
   - Realms: Testing focused on custom features only

4. **Security Review**
   - Full Custom: Full security audit required
   - Realms: Limited review of custom components

5. **Deployment Complexity**
   - Full Custom: Complex deployment process
   - Realms: Streamlined deployment using existing tools

### Risk Assessment

| Risk Factor | Full Custom | Realms-Based |
|-------------|------------|--------------|
| Development Delays | High | Low |
| Security Vulnerabilities | High | Low |
| Integration Issues | Medium | Low |
| Maintenance Complexity | High | Low |
| Upgrade Challenges | Medium | Low |
